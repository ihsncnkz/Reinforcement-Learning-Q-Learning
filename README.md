## Introduction
<p>
  Hello, I am Ihsan, I am improving myself the Data science, Machine learning, Deep learning and computer vision under the name of artificial intelligence. In this project, I worked on the q-learning model of reinforcement learning, which is one of the branches of machine learning. First of all, I performed a simple q learning training without neural networks in the Q Learning With Gym Library section. Secondly, I performed q-learning training with ANN(artificial neural network) in the Deep_Q-Learning section. Finally, I performed q-learning training with CNN(convolutional neural network) in the DeepConv_Q-Learning section. My target in this project stepped the reinforcement learning and had information about the q learning model. At the same time, I wanted to share my work with you. I hope it has been a useful work for you. I wish have a nice day and nice work.

## What is the Reinforcement Learning?
<p>
  Reinforcement learning is an area of Machine Learning. It is about taking suitable action to maximize reward in a particular situation. It is employed by various software and machines to find the best possible behavior or path it should take in a specific situation. Reinforcement learning differs from supervised learning in a way that in supervised learning the training data has the answer key with it so the model is trained with the correct answer itself whereas in reinforcement learning, there is no answer but the reinforcement agent decides what to do to perform the given task. In the absence of a training dataset, it is bound to learn from its experience.

## What is the Q Learning?
  Q-Learning is a Reinforcement learning policy that will find the next best action, given a current state. It chooses this action at random and aims to maximize the reward.
