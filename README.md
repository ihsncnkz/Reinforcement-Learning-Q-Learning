<p>
  Hello, When I continue to learn stayed from the place at this work. I both learned the q-learning model, which is the reinforcement learning model of machine learning, and carried out this study on it. In this work, I used the environments of the gym library prepared by Openai. There is an agent in this environments and This agent has to overcome difficulties and achieve their goals optimally. I used the q-learning model to reach its goals with the best results.
  
Tools used in this project:
- Python(3.9)
- Numpy(1.21.5)
- Random(1.2.2)
- Matplotlib(3.5.2)
- CliffWalking-v0 (Openai Gym Enviroment)
- FrozenLake-v1 (Openai Gym Enviroment)
- Taxi-v3 (Openai Gym Enviroment)

## What is the Q Learning?
  Q-Learning is a Reinforcement learning policy that will find the next best action, given a current state. It chooses this action at random and aims to maximize the reward.
